Time Complexity: O(N)  
Each node in the tree is visited at most once during the DFS, so the total time complexity is linear in the number of nodes N.

---
Space Complexity: O(H)  
The space is used by the recursion call stack, where H is the height of the tree.
In the worst case (a skewed tree), H = N; in a balanced tree, H = log N.
